This repository contains three C++ projects that I created for CodSoft while doing internship in CodSoft. The projects are:

Movie Ticket Booking System: A program that allows users to book movie tickets online, choose their seats.

Random Number Guessing Game: A game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. The user gets feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low, and has a unlimited number of attempts.

Simple Calculator: A program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user.

# Movie Ticket Booking System

• The program displays a list of movies available for booking.

• The user can select a movie and see available and occupied seats.

• The user can choose their numbers of seats.

# Random Number Guessing Game

• The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it.

• The user has unlimited attempts to guess the number correctly.

• The program keeps track of the user’s score, which is based on how many attempts they used to guess the number.

• The program displays a message when the user wins or loses the game, and asks if they want to play again.

# Simple Calculator

• The program asks the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, or /).

• The program performs the arithmetic operation on the two numbers and displays the result.

• The program handles invalid inputs such as zero division, non-numerical inputs, and invalid operators.

• The program asks if the user wants to perform another calculation.
